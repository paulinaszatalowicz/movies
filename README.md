# A moviestream company wants to buy the rights to stream a new comedy to their clients. The business task was to analyze a given dataset and help to make a data-driven decision about which movie rights' to buy.
# I have written a query that filters the dataset leaving comedy movies with total revenue over $300 milion and sorted it from the most recent release dates to the oldest
# As a result I ended up with a list of 7 most recommended movies to buy licence of.
